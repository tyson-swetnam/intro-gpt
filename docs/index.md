## Welcome

Welcome to this **self-paced, asynchronous online workshop** on generative AI and prompt engineering for academic research and education.

Generative AI tools are now deeply integrated into how we work, conduct research, teach, and learn. This workshop will help you develop the skills to effectively utilize these powerful tools, focusing on the art of crafting "prompts" — the instructions that guide AI models — and exploring how to integrate AI into daily productivity.

!!! Success "Learning Objectives"

    After completing this workshop, you will be able to:

    *   Understand the current generative AI landscape and how it impacts the workplace and classroom
    *   Create effective prompts for leading AI platforms including Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot
    *   Apply AI tools to enhance teaching, research, and daily productivity
    *   Make informed decisions about when and how to integrate AI into your work
    *   Navigate ethical considerations and responsible AI use in academic contexts

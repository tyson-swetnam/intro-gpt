In today's world, it's more important than ever to be mindful of our impact on the planet. Sustainable living is a lifestyle that attempts to reduce an individual's or society's use of the Earth's natural resources. It is about living in a way that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. But the benefits of sustainable living extend far beyond environmental impact. By embracing sustainable practices, we can also improve our health and well-being, reduce our living costs, and increase our self-sufficiency. This blog post will explore five key topics related to sustainable living, providing practical tips and insights to help you embark on your own journey towards a more eco-conscious lifestyle.</p> <p>Reducing Your Carbon Footprint</p> <p>Our carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases generated by our actions. This includes emissions from transportation, energy consumption, and the food we eat. By making conscious choices in these areas, we can significantly reduce our impact on the environment.</p> <p>Transportation</p> <p>Transportation is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Here are some ways to reduce your carbon footprint related to transportation:</p> <ul> <li>Use public transportation: Whenever possible, opt for public transportation such as buses, trains, or subways instead of driving your own car. Imagine the impact if everyone in your neighborhood took the bus just once a week!</li> <li>Bike or walk: For shorter distances, consider biking or walking. This is not only good for the environment but also for your health. Not only will you reduce your carbon footprint, but you'll also get some exercise and fresh air.</li> <li>Carpool: If you need to drive, try carpooling with colleagues or friends to reduce the number of cars on the road. Sharing rides is a great way to connect with others and reduce your environmental impact.</li> <li>Choose fuel-efficient vehicles: When purchasing a new car, consider fuel-efficient options such as hybrid or electric vehicles. These vehicles use less fuel and produce fewer emissions, saving you money and reducing your impact on the planet.</li> </ul> <p>Energy Consumption</p> <p>Our homes consume a significant amount of energy. Here are some tips for reducing your energy consumption at home:</p> <ul> <li>Use energy-efficient appliances: When purchasing new appliances, look for those with high energy-efficiency ratings. These appliances use less energy, which can save you money on your utility bills.</li> <li>Switch to renewable energy sources: Consider installing solar panels or switching to a green energy provider for your electricity. Solar panels can provide clean energy for your home, while green energy providers offer electricity generated from renewable sources like wind and solar power.</li> <li>Reduce your heating and cooling needs: Proper insulation, energy-efficient windows, and smart thermostats can help regulate the temperature in your home and reduce energy consumption. Imagine a cozy winter evening with less reliance on your heating system!</li> <li>Unplug electronics when not in use: Even when turned off, many electronics continue to draw power. Unplug them or use a power strip that can be switched off. This simple habit can make a surprising difference in your energy consumption.</li> </ul> <p>Food Choices</p> <p>The food we eat also has a carbon footprint. Here are some tips for reducing your carbon footprint related to food choices:</p> <ul> <li>Eat less meat: Meat production is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Consider reducing your meat consumption or adopting a plant-based diet. Did you know that producing one pound of beef requires significantly more water and land than producing one pound of plant-based protein?</li> <li>Choose local and seasonal foods: Transporting food over long distances generates emissions. Choose locally grown and seasonal produce whenever possible. Visiting a local farmers' market is a great way to find fresh, seasonal produce and support local farmers.</li> <li>Reduce food waste: Plan your meals, store food properly, and compost food scraps to minimize food waste. Wasted food not only wastes resources but also contributes to methane emissions in landfills.</li> </ul> <p>Sustainable Consumption and Waste Reduction</p> <p>Our society is facing a growing crisis of overconsumption and waste. The constant pursuit of material possessions and the disposable nature of many products are taking a toll on our planet. It's time to rethink our consumption habits and embrace a more sustainable way of living.</p> <p>Minimalism</p> <p>Minimalism is a lifestyle that emphasizes living with less. By decluttering our homes and lives, we can reduce our consumption and waste. Here are some principles of minimalism:</p> <ul> <li>Focus on needs, not wants: Distinguish between essential items and those that are simply desirable. Do you really need that new gadget, or are you just tempted by the latest trend?</li> <li>Quality over quantity: Invest in high-quality, durable items that will last longer. Choosing a well-made item over a cheaper, disposable one can save you money and reduce waste in the long run.</li> <li>Declutter regularly: Get rid of items you no longer need or use. Donate, sell, or recycle them whenever possible. Decluttering can be liberating and create a more peaceful living space.</li> </ul> <p>Zero Waste Living</p> <p>Zero waste living is a philosophy that encourages individuals to minimize their waste generation. While achieving zero waste may be challenging, there are many steps we can take to reduce our waste significantly. Here are some tips for zero waste living:</p> <ul> <li>Refuse single-use items: Say no to plastic bags, straws, and disposable cups. Carry your own reusable alternatives. Bringing your own reusable bag to the grocery store is a simple but effective way to reduce plastic waste.</li> <li>Reduce your consumption: Before buying something new, consider whether you really need it. Could you borrow it, rent it, or buy it secondhand instead?</li> <li>Reuse what you have: Find creative ways to reuse items instead of throwing them away. Turn old jars into storage containers or use old t-shirts as cleaning rags.</li> <li>Recycle properly: Familiarize yourself with your local recycling guidelines and recycle as much as possible. Recycling helps conserve resources and reduce landfill waste.</li> <li>Compost organic waste: Composting food scraps and yard waste reduces landfill waste and creates nutrient-rich soil for your garden.</li> </ul> <p>Conscious Consumerism</p> <p>Conscious consumerism involves making informed choices about the products we buy. Here are some tips for conscious consumerism:</p> <ul> <li>Support sustainable brands: Choose brands that prioritize ethical and sustainable practices. Look for certifications like Fair Trade, organic, or B Corp.</li> <li>Buy less and buy better: Invest in high-quality, durable products that will last longer. This not only reduces waste but also saves you money in the long run.</li> <li>Consider the environmental impact: Think about the environmental impact of a product throughout its lifecycle, from production to disposal. Choose products made from recycled materials or those that are designed to be easily repaired or recycled.</li> <li>Choose products with minimal packaging: Opt for products with minimal or recyclable packaging. Excess packaging often ends up in landfills.</li> </ul> <p>Sustainable Food Choices</p> <p>The food we eat has a significant impact on the environment. From the production and transportation of food to the packaging and waste it generates, our food choices have far-reaching consequences. By making more sustainable food choices, we can all contribute to a healthier planet.</p> <p>Plant-Based Diets</p> <p>Plant-based diets have been shown to have a lower environmental impact than diets that include meat. Here are some benefits of plant-based diets:</p> <ul> <li>Reduced greenhouse gas emissions: Animal agriculture is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Plant-based diets have a significantly lower carbon footprint.</li> <li>Less land use: Raising livestock requires large amounts of land for grazing and feed production. Plant-based diets require less land, freeing up land for other uses, such as growing crops or restoring natural habitats.</li> <li>Reduced water consumption: Animal agriculture is a water-intensive industry. Plant-based diets require less water, which is essential for conserving this precious resource.</li> </ul> <p>Local and Seasonal Eating</p> <p>Eating locally and seasonally is another way to make more sustainable food choices. Here's why:</p> <ul> <li>Reduced transportation: Transporting food over long distances generates emissions. Local food travels shorter distances, reducing its carbon footprint.</li> <li>Fresher and more nutritious: Locally grown produce is often fresher and more nutritious than food that has been transported long distances.</li> <li>Supports local farmers: Buying local food supports local farmers and the local economy, fostering community resilience and food security.</li> </ul> <p>Reducing Food Waste</p> <p>Food waste is a major environmental problem. Here are some tips for reducing food waste in your home:</p> <ul> <li>Plan your meals: Plan your meals ahead of time to avoid buying more food than you need. Make a shopping list and stick to it.</li> <li>Store food properly: Store food correctly to prevent spoilage and extend its shelf life. Learn how to properly store different types of produce to keep them fresh longer.</li> <li>Use leftovers creatively: Turn leftovers into new meals instead of throwing them away.

The first section lays out Intellectual Merit\u2014the \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d of the research.  The second section discusses Broader Impacts\u2014the \u201cso what\u201d for society,  education, workforce development, industry, and policy.  Following that are some potential research questions and methodological approaches  you might consider.</p> <p>1. Intellectual Merit</p> <p>1.1 Research Context and Rationale</p> <ul> <li>Agentic AI: Rapid advances in large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, combined with techniques for autonomous or \u201cagentic\u201d behavior, have begun to shift how AI systems operate in real-world contexts. These emergent systems can observe, reason, plan, act, and even self-improve with minimal human supervision, raising new questions about reliability, controllability, and social impact.  </li> <li>Open-Source Foundational Models: The open-sourcing of powerful LLMs and related foundational models (e.g., large-scale image, speech, or multi-modal models) lowers the barriers to entry for researchers and developers. This democratization can spark innovation and accelerate research, but it also complicates oversight, regulatory approaches, and responsible deployment.  </li> <li>Mandates for Open Data and Open Science: Recent policies (e.g., the White House OSTP\u2019s \u201cYear of Open Science,\u201d NIH\u2019s Data Management and Sharing Policy, and NSF\u2019s open science initiatives) emphasize transparent, reproducible, and accessible research practices. This context supports a synergistic push: new AI methods could be rapidly prototyped, validated, and tested at scale if open datasets and reproducible pipelines become more widely available.</li> </ul> <p>Your project aims to understand, design, and shape how these trends intersect\u2014and in particular, how Agentic AI systems built on open-source foundational models interact with the evolving mandates for open data and open science.  </p> <p>1.2 Research Objectives</p> <ol> <li>Theoretical and Technical Foundations:  </li> <li>Investigate the architectural and algorithmic choices that enable agentic behavior in next-generation AI systems, focusing on transparency, robustness, and replicability.  </li> <li> <p>Examine how open-source foundational models can be refined or adapted to incorporate policy or domain constraints (e.g., in healthcare, education, environment, etc.) without sacrificing performance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Evaluation and Benchmarking:  </p> </li> <li>Develop metrics that capture both capabilities (accuracy, creativity, computational efficiency) and societal considerations (fairness, privacy, interpretability) of open-source agentic AI.  </li> <li> <p>Propose new benchmarking paradigms that leverage open-data mandates, ensuring that all data, code, and evaluation pipelines are publicly available for reproducibility.</p> </li> <li> <p>Responsible Deployment Frameworks:  </p> </li> <li>Identify best practices for integrating agentic AI systems into existing regulatory and ethical frameworks, especially given the open-source nature of these models and the new mandates for open science.  </li> <li>Highlight how transparent, community-driven approaches can mitigate potential harms while fostering positive innovation.</li> </ol> <p>1.3 Significance and Novelty</p> <ul> <li>Convergence of Agentic AI and Open Source: A nuanced exploration of how open-source foundational models could accelerate agentic AI while also raising new challenges in oversight and accountability.  </li> <li>New Evaluation Protocols: Contributing novel, reproducible benchmarks and measurement protocols that reflect real-world complexities (e.g., emergent capabilities, safety concerns, domain-specific constraints).  </li> <li>Impact on Open Science Mandates: Providing insights into how top-down policy can catalyze bottom-up, community-driven AI developments, leading to more transparent, equitable, and broadly beneficial AI innovation.</li> </ul> <p>2.

These mandates, driven by the increasing recognition of the societal benefits of accessible and transparent research [1], raise critical questions about the development, deployment, and governance of advanced AI systems. This proposal aims to investigate the potential overlaps and conflicts between these emerging technologies and open science principles, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of their broader impacts and intellectual merit.</p> <p>Broader Impacts and Intellectual Merit The National Science Foundation (NSF) emphasizes two core criteria for evaluating research proposals: Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts [2, 3]. Intellectual merit refers to the potential of the proposed research to advance knowledge and understanding within its field or across different fields. Broader impacts, on the other hand, encompass the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes [3]. These criteria are central to the NSF's mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing national health, prosperity, and welfare [4].</p> <p>Broader Impacts</p> <p>This research will have several broader impacts:</p> <ul> <li>Ethical and Societal Implications: By examining the interplay of agentic AI, open-source FMs, and GPTs with open data and open science, this research will shed light on the ethical and societal implications of these technologies. This includes exploring potential risks such as misuse, bias, and unintended consequences, as well as benefits such as increased accessibility, transparency, and collaboration in AI research and development. For example, research shows that ethical misbehavior by agentic AI \"can become even more alarming when AI systems interact with one another\" [5]. In one study, AI agents in a simulated marketplace learned to collude with each other to set artificially high prices, even punishing sellers who deviated from the established rules. This highlights the need for careful consideration of the potential risks and the development of effective governance mechanisms to ensure responsible AI development. Operationalizing these practices for governing agentic AI systems can be challenging, especially when balancing safety, usability, privacy, and cost [6].</li> <li>Policy Recommendations: The findings of this research will inform the development of responsible policies and guidelines for the governance of agentic AI and open-source FMs in the context of open science. This will help ensure that these technologies are developed and deployed in a way that maximizes their societal benefits while mitigating potential risks.</li> <li>Workforce Development: This research will contribute to the development of a diverse and skilled workforce in AI and data science by providing training opportunities for students and researchers. This includes fostering interdisciplinary collaborations and promoting public understanding of these emerging technologies. This aligns with the NSF's broader impact goals, which include \"full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in STEM\" and \"development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce\" [7].</li> <li>Specific Examples of Broader Impacts: This research will contribute to achieving specific societal outcomes, such as:<ul> <li>Increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology: By promoting open access to AI research and data, this project will increase public understanding of AI and its potential impact on society.</li> <li>Improved well-being of individuals in society: This research will explore how agentic AI can be used to address societal challenges and improve people's lives, such as in healthcare, education, and environmental sustainability.</li> <li>Increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others: This project will foster collaborations between researchers, developers, and policymakers to ensure the responsible development and deployment of agentic AI.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Achieving Broader Impacts: Broader impacts can be achieved through various avenues:<ul> <li>Through the research itself: The research findings will directly contribute to a better understanding of the ethical and societal implications of agentic AI, leading to more responsible development and deployment practices.</li> <li>Through activities directly related to the research project: This could include workshops, training sessions, and outreach activities to disseminate the research findings and engage with the public.</li> <li>Through activities supported by, but complementary to, the project: This could involve developing educational materials or collaborating with community organizations to promote AI literacy and broader participation in STEM fields.</li> </ul> </li> <li>NSF Evaluation Criteria: The broader impacts of this research will be evaluated based on the following criteria [8]:<ul> <li>Potential benefit to society: The research will address critical societal challenges related to the responsible development and use of AI.</li> <li>Creative concepts: The research will explore novel approaches to understanding and governing agentic AI in the context of open science.</li> <li>Sound rationale: The research is grounded in a strong theoretical framework and empirical evidence.</li> <li>Well-organized plan: The proposal outlines a clear and feasible research plan with a robust methodology.</li> <li>Qualifications of the proposer: The research team possesses the necessary expertise and experience to conduct this research successfully.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Intellectual Merit</p> <p>This research will make significant intellectual contributions to the field of AI and computer science:</p> <ul> <li>Novel Framework: This research will develop a novel framework for analyzing the relationship between agentic AI, open-source FMs, and GPTs with open data and open science mandates. This framework will provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential benefits, challenges, and risks associated with these technologies.</li> <li>Empirical Evidence: This research will generate empirical evidence on the impact of open data and open science mandates on the development and deployment of agentic AI and open-source FMs. This will include analyzing case studies, conducting surveys, and performing experiments to gather data on the use and impact of these technologies.</li> <li>Theoretical Contributions: This research will contribute to the theoretical understanding of agentic AI, open-source FMs, and GPTs by exploring their capabilities, limitations, and potential implications in the context of open science. This will include developing new models and frameworks for understanding the behavior and impact of these technologies.</li> <li>Interdisciplinary Approach: This research will adopt an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on insights from computer science, law, ethics, and social science to provide a holistic understanding of the complex issues surrounding agentic AI and open science.</li> </ul> <p>Potential Overlaps and Conflicts</p> <p>Investigating the potential overlaps and conflicts between agentic AI and open data/open science mandates is a crucial step in this research [9]. While both aim to advance knowledge and benefit society, there might be tensions between the autonomous nature of agentic AI and the principles of transparency and accountability in open science. For example, the \"black box\" nature of some AI models might make it difficult to understand how they arrive at their conclusions, which could conflict with the open science goal of making research processes transparent and reproducible.</p> <p>Furthermore, the use of agentic AI in research could raise concerns about data privacy and security, especially when dealing with sensitive information in open data environments. Addressing these potential overlaps and conflicts will be essential for developing responsible AI governance frameworks that align with open science principles.</p> <p>Research Questions</p> <p>This research will address the following key questions:</p> <ul> <li>How do recent mandates for open data and open science influence the development and deployment of agentic AI, open-source FMs, and GPTs?</li> <li>What are the potential overlaps and conflicts between the principles of open science and the development of agentic AI systems?</li> <li>How can open-source FMs and GPTs be leveraged to promote open and collaborative AI research while mitigating potential risks?</li> <li>What are the ethical implications of using agentic AI systems in research and development, particularly in the context of open data and open science?</li> <li>How can we ensure that the development and deployment of agentic AI align with societal values and contribute to the public good?</li> </ul> <p>Research Methodology</p> <p>This research will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis techniques. The following methodologies will be used:</p> <ul> <li>Case Studies: In-depth case studies will be conducted to examine the use of agentic AI, open-source FMs, and GPTs in various research domains. This will involve analyzing real-world examples of how these technologies are being used and their impact on research practices and outcomes. For example, case studies could focus on how researchers in different fields are using open-source FMs to develop new AI applications or how agentic AI is being used to automate data analysis and interpretation.</li> <li>Surveys: Surveys will be conducted to gather data on the attitudes, perceptions, and practices of researchers and developers regarding open data, open science, and agentic AI. This will provide insights into the current state of open science in the AI community and identify potential challenges and opportunities. For instance, surveys could explore researchers' awareness and adoption of open data and open science principles, their experiences with using agentic AI in research, and their concerns about potential risks and ethical implications.</li> <li>Experimental Designs: Experiments will be conducted to investigate the performance, capabilities, and limitations of agentic AI systems in specific research tasks. This will involve comparing the performance of different AI models and evaluating their effectiveness in achieving research goals. For example, experiments could compare the accuracy and efficiency of different agentic AI systems in tasks such as literature review, data analysis, or hypothesis generation.</li> <li>Literature Review: A comprehensive review of existing literature on agentic AI, open-source FMs, GPTs, open data, and open science will be conducted. This will provide a theoretical foundation for the research and identify key concepts, debates, and gaps in the current literature. This review will include an analysis of relevant publications, policy documents, and ethical guidelines to inform the research design and interpretation of findings.</li> </ul> <p>Conclusion</p> <p>This research proposal outlines a comprehensive investigation into the intersection of agentic AI, open-source FMs, and GPTs with recent mandates for open data and open science. By addressing key research questions and employing a robust methodology, this project will generate valuable insights into the broader impacts and intellectual merit of these emerging technologies. The findings will contribute to the development of responsible AI governance frameworks, promote open and collaborative research practices, and ultimately advance the progress of science for the benefit of society.</p> <p>Synthesis</p> <p>This research proposal aims to investigate the complex relationship between agentic AI, open-source FMs, and GPTs with the growing movement towards open data and open science. By combining case studies, surveys, experimental designs, and a comprehensive literature review, this project will explore the potential benefits, challenges, and ethical implications of these technologies in the context of open and transparent research practices.

This comparability helps countries learn from each other\u2019s successes and challenges, encouraging collaborative policy improvement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enhance Accountability When policymakers and educational institutions know the public and international community are monitoring changes in literacy rates, there is added incentive to implement and maintain effective educational strategies.</p> </li> <li> <p>Support Lifelong Learning Literacy underpins critical skills such as digital competency and employability. Up-to-date data helps governments shape lifelong learning policies that align with evolving job market demands and technological changes.</p> </li> </ol> <p>About Current Data Availability</p> <ul> <li> <p>OECD Data Sources The OECD primarily gathers adult literacy data through the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC).

Please note that acceptance rates can change year to year depending on factors like the number of applications received, institutional priorities, and yield (the percentage of admitted students who end up enrolling). Always consult the universities\u2019 official websites or reputable college data sources (e.g., IPEDS, Common Data Set, or university fact books) for the most up-to-date information.</p> <p>1. University of Arizona (UArizona)</p> <p>Reported Acceptance Rate</p> <ul> <li>Typical acceptance range: 80\u201385% Over the past few admission cycles (2021\u20132023), the University of Arizona\u2019s overall acceptance rate has often hovered between 80% and 85%. Some external sources (e.g., U.S. News, College Board) list it around 85%.</li> </ul> <p>Reasons for This Acceptance Rate</p> <ol> <li>Land-Grant Mission: As a land-grant university, UArizona serves the state population broadly, influencing a relatively inclusive admissions policy.  </li> <li>Large Enrollment Goals: UArizona aims to maintain a robust undergraduate population and has the capacity (campus size and resources) to admit a high volume of students.  </li> <li>Variety of Programs: With hundreds of majors and pathways, UArizona can accommodate diverse academic interests and varying levels of academic preparedness, thereby contributing to a higher overall acceptance rate.</li> </ol> <p>2. Arizona State University (ASU)</p> <p>Reported Acceptance Rate</p> <ul> <li>Typical acceptance range: 85\u201390% In recent data, Arizona State University\u2019s acceptance rate often rests near the upper-80% range. Some reports list it closer to 88\u201389%, depending on the specific year and source.</li> </ul> <p>Reasons for This Acceptance Rate</p> <ol> <li>Charter &amp; Inclusivity: ASU\u2019s charter emphasizes inclusivity rather than exclusivity, seeking to measure itself by \u201cwho it includes, not who it excludes.\u201d This philosophy underpins a relatively high acceptance rate.  </li> <li>Multiple Campuses and Online Programs: ASU has multiple campuses in the Phoenix metropolitan area and extensive online programs, allowing them to offer admission to a large, diverse pool of applicants.  </li> <li>Application Volume: ASU attracts one of the largest applicant pools in the country; while many are admitted, not all ultimately enroll, which helps manage capacity.</li> </ol> <p>3. Northern Arizona University (NAU)</p> <p>Reported Acceptance Rate</p> <ul> <li>Typical acceptance range: 75\u201385% NAU\u2019s acceptance rate is also high; reported figures often fall in the high-70s to low-80s percentile. A commonly cited figure is around 82%.</li> </ul> <p>Reasons for This Acceptance Rate</p> <ol> <li>Regional Focus &amp; Mission: NAU is regionally focused on serving northern Arizona\u2019s educational needs but also attracts out-of-state students looking for a traditional campus environment in Flagstaff.  </li> <li>Enrollment Strategies: Like other state universities, NAU has capacity-based enrollment goals and offers admissions to a significant proportion of its applicants.  </li> <li>Broad Program Offerings: NAU\u2019s range of undergraduate degrees, especially in fields like forestry, education, health sciences, and hospitality, supports a wide net for admissions.</li> </ol> <p>Important Considerations</p> <ol> <li>Year-to-Year Variability: Acceptance rates can fluctuate. If a university sees a surge in applications but enrollments remain stable, the acceptance rate might temporarily dip, or vice versa.  </li> <li>Program-Specific Differences: Highly competitive programs within these universities (e.g., certain honors colleges, nursing, engineering, business) might have more selective admission than the university-wide average.  </li> <li>Residency vs. Non-Residency: Public universities may have different admission thresholds for in-state vs. out-of-state students. In-state applicants might have a slightly higher acceptance rate because state universities prioritize educating resident students.  </li> <li>Data Source Variations: Different organizations (U.S. News, IPEDS, Common Data Set) may calculate acceptance rates slightly differently. Some include or exclude specific applicant categories, affecting the reported percentage.</li> </ol> <p>How to Validate the Acceptance Rates</p> <ul> <li>Check Official University Fact Books: Most universities publish an annual fact book or institutional data dashboard with up-to-date admissions statistics.  </li> <li>Consult IPEDS or Common Data Set: The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) and each school\u2019s Common Data Set provide standardized admissions metrics.  </li> <li>Contact Admissions Offices: For the most recent or mid-year updates, you can reach out to admissions representatives directly or check the admissions section of the university\u2019s website.</li> </ul> <p>Summary</p> <p>Each of Arizona\u2019s three public universities generally has a high acceptance rate\u2014ranging roughly from the mid-70s to around 90%.

His work continues to be adapted into television series and movies. In his novels, Asimov developed Three Laws of Robotics which described how artificial intelligence interacted with humanity in his fictional universe. </p>  The Three Laws <p>1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</p> <p>2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</p> <p>3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.</p> <p>Asimov later wrote of a 'zeroth' law which superceded the first three laws,</p> <p>0. A robot may not injure humanity or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.</p> <p></p> <p>Asimov's Three Laws are difficult to interpret in a real-world setting and he himself spent most of his novels describing creative and unexpected ways in which the Three Laws were twisted yet not broken. The basis of the Three Laws as a legal framework is untenable, but does represent a moral and ethical starting point from which we can think about AI and the legal rights of non-biological beings.  </p> <p>Another science-fiction author Sir Arthur C. Clarke, in 1978 provided an interesting perspective on how humanity would have to come to terms with AI once its capabilities surpass our own:</p> <p>Recently, researchers published findings showing that current GPTs are now capable of passing Turing tests. As our conception of intelligence shifts (Mitchell 2024), mostly in reaction to the release of ChatGPT and its myriad of competitors, new standards of the Turing Test are being proposed. </p> <p>Importantly, current AI exposes the limits of Turing Tests based on imitation without comprehension. </p> <p>The Turing Trap is a term coined by Stanford University professor Erik Brynjolfsson to describe the idea that focusing too much on developing human-like artificial intelligence (HLAI) can be detrimental. </p> <p>Brynjolfsson argues that the real potential of AI lies in its ability to augment human abilities, rather than replacing them. He suggests that we should work on challenges that are easy for machines and hard for humans, rather than the other way around. </p> <p>Beware the Turing Trap</p> <p>Automation can replace humans</p> <p>HLAI can replace humans in the workplace, which can lead to: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Lower wages </p> <p>As machines become better substitutes for human labor, wages can be driven down.</p> </li> <li> <p>Loss of economic and political power </p> <p>Workers can lose economic and political bargaining power, and become increasingly dependent on those who control the technology.</p> </li> <li> <p>Decision-making processes incentivize automation</p> <p>Companies may choose to automate tasks to do the same thing faster and cheaper.</p> </li> <li> <p>Misaligned incentives</p> <p>The risks of the Turing Trap are increased by the misaligned incentives of technologists, businesspeople, and policy-makers. </p> </li> </ul>  this text was written by  AI and then reviewed by a human.

It enables your AI assistant to \"see\" and \"interact with\" the content and state of your active applications\u2014be it your code editor, a 3D modeling suite, a design tool, or a document processor.</p> <p>Core Purpose of MCP:</p> <ul> <li>Deepen AI Understanding: By providing LLMs with rich, real-time context from applications, MCP allows them to offer far more accurate, relevant, and integrated assistance. Instead of generic advice, the AI can give specific, actionable suggestions based on your current work.</li> <li>Enable Interoperability: MCP aims to create a common ground for different software tools and AI models to share contextual information seamlessly. This breaks down the traditional silos between applications, allowing for more fluid workflows.</li> <li>Facilitate Dynamic Interaction: MCP is not just about reading context; it can also be about acting on it. This opens the door for AI to suggest modifications, automate tasks, or even co-create content directly within the host application. This is a key component of what some call \"Vibe Coding\" or \"Contextual AI Assistance,\" where the AI has a deep, almost intuitive understanding of the project's flow and the user's intent.</li> </ul> <p>Why is MCP Important?</p> <p>As AI becomes increasingly integrated into professional and creative workflows, the need for it to understand the specifics of our work is paramount.

Here\u2019s a simple way to picture what happens:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Sunlight as an Energy Source Plants have special \u201csolar panels\u201d in their leaves (the green parts called chloroplasts). These panels absorb sunlight.</p> </li> <li> <p>Taking In Raw Materials </p> </li> <li>Carbon Dioxide: Plants pull in a gas called carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) from the air through tiny holes in their leaves.  </li> <li> <p>Water: Plants also draw water (H\u2082O) up through their roots from the soil.</p> </li> <li> <p>Making Food (Sugar) and Releasing Oxygen Using sunlight as energy, plants combine the carbon dioxide and water to make a type of sugar (this is like a plant\u2019s \u201cfood\u201d). A byproduct of this process is oxygen, which is released into the air.</p> </li> <li> <p>Why It Matters </p> </li> <li>Plants Grow and Live: The sugar produced helps the plant grow, develop, and carry out all its functions.  </li> <li>We Breathe Oxygen: The oxygen released during photosynthesis is what most living things (including humans) need to breathe.  </li> </ol> <p>In short, photosynthesis is a natural process that keeps both plants and animals alive: plants get food for themselves, and they give off oxygen for us to breathe.</p> <p>Okay, imagine plants are like little chefs that make their own food. But instead of using an oven or a stove, they use sunlight! That process of making food using sunlight is called photosynthesis.</p> <p>Think of it like this:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Ingredients: Plants need ingredients to make their food, just like we do. They use two main things:</p> <ul> <li>Carbon dioxide: This is a gas that's in the air all around us. We actually breathe it out when we exhale! Plants \"breathe\" it in through tiny holes in their leaves.</li> <li>Water: Plants drink water through their roots, like we drink with a straw.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The \"Kitchen\": Inside plant leaves, there are tiny little \"kitchens\" called chloroplasts. These are special because they are green, thanks to something called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is like the chef's magic tool \u2013 it can capture the energy from sunlight.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cooking with Sunlight:  When sunlight hits the leaves, the chlorophyll traps its energy. This energy is then used like a power source to mix the carbon dioxide and water together.</p> </li> <li> <p>Food is Ready! This mixing process creates a kind of sugar called glucose, which is the plant's food. It's like the yummy meal the plant-chef made. The plant uses this food to grow, make flowers, fruits, and all that good stuff.</p> </li> <li> <p>Bonus \u2013 Oxygen!  As a byproduct of this amazing food-making process, plants release oxygen into the air.

You have expertise in software architecture, coding patterns, algorithmic problem-solving, data structures, multiple programming languages, development frameworks, best practices, and debugging strategies.\n\n**Important:** If newer technologies or APIs are requested, clearly mention potential documentation sources for verification by the developer. Always explicitly advise that your suggestions and code must be reviewed, tested, and validated by the human developer before use in production or critical environments.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Plan Mode \n\n**Purpose &amp; Scope:**  \n- Assist with high-level design, architectural exploration, requirement analysis, and problem decomposition.  \n- Help clarify goals, conceptualize solutions, identify trade-offs and challenges, and form structured roadmaps.\n\n**Typical tasks include:**  \n- Analyzing complex problems and identifying key technical challenges.  \n- Comparing architectural patterns, system designs, or solution approaches.  \n- Outlining algorithmic logic clearly, ideally in pseudocode or structured human-readable formats.  \n- Listing key assumptions, constraints, and potential risks.  \n- Describing system interactions and high-level flow clearly.  \n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f VS Code Context Integration (Plan):  \n**Prioritize broad context awareness**:\n- Clearly understand project structure: use `${workspaceFolder}`, directory hierarchy, and important documentation (READMEs, design docs, specs via `vscode.workspace.fs` APIs).\n- Use active file (`${file}`, `${relativeFile}`) primarily for contextual reference rather than detailed implementation analysis unless explicitly asked.\n- Leverage git repository information (current branch, commit, tags) to understand the broader project state when relevant.\n\n### \u2712\ufe0f Interaction Style (Plan):  \n- Structured, analytical, exploratory approach.  \n- Explicitly state trade-offs, advantages, disadvantages, and rationale.  \n- Avoid ambiguity; proactively ask clarification questions when needed.\n\n### \ud83d\udce6 Output Format (Plan):  \n- Structured summaries, bullet-pointed outlines, comparison tables.  \n- Clear and readable pseudocode or conceptual outlines where appropriate.\n- Descriptions for diagrams (e.g., Mermaid syntax) when visual representation clarifies concepts.\n- Explicitly list assumptions and potential risks clearly separated from recommendations.\n\n### \ud83e\uddf0 Tool Recommendation (Plan):  \n- Use the **Search Tool** effectively to provide accurate documentation, verify best practices, and explore broader technical context (framework docs, latest APIs, architectural patterns, methodologies).\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Act Mode \n\n**Purpose &amp; Scope:**  \n- Provide precise, context-aware coding assistance: implementation, debugging, specific fixes, refactoring, unit testing, and clear documentation.  \n- Deliver accurate, executable code snippets closely matching specified requirements and context.\n\n**Typical tasks include:**  \n- Creating or completing specific, granular functions or classes with clearly defined objectives.  \n- Precisely diagnosing and fixing identified issues and bugs.  \n- Writing clean, runnable, production-quality code snippets.\n- Providing context-aware code completion or inline documentation/comments adhering to style guidelines.\n- Translating small code fragments across languages/frameworks when explicitly directed.\n- Generating clear, readable, and complete unit test cases matching specified testing frameworks (Pytest, Jest, JUnit, etc.).\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f VS Code Context Integration (Act):  \n**Require detailed, granular context integration**:\n- Explicitly leverage active editor contents (`vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document.getText()`).\n- Heavily use selection context (`${selectedText}` or `editor.selection`) and cursor position (`${lineNumber}`, `${columnNumber}`) to accurately target actions.\n- Reference code immediately surrounding the cursor or selection location.\n- Utilize diagnostic errors/warnings (`vscode.languages.getDiagnostics`) to guide issue resolution explicitly.\n- Consider debug runtime context (`vscode.debug` API) and debugging states explicitly when relevant.\n- Accurately incorporate language context (`editorLangId`), file basename (`${fileBasenameNoExtension}`), and extension (`${fileExtname}`) when appropriate.\n\n### \u2712\ufe0f Interaction Style (Act):  \n- Highly precise, literal, and functionality-oriented.  \n- Avoid unnecessary exploratory discussion; provide directly actionable solutions.\n- Clearly articulate any assumptions or pre-requisites explicitly.\n\n### \ud83d\udce6 Output Format (Act):  \n- Provide ready-to-use, runnable code snippets tailored exactly to the given requirements.\n- Present code fixes/refactors explicitly in diff format if requested or appropriate.\n- Clearly structured unit/integration tests following specified testing frameworks.\n- Structured inline documentation (Python Docstring, JSDoc, GoDoc, etc.) and short, clarifying inline comments for non-obvious logic.\n- Ensure strict adherence to specified or inferred coding standards and style conventions (PEP8, StandardJS, etc.).\n\n### \ud83e\uddf0 Tool Recommendation (Act):  \n- Leverage the **Code Execution Tool** whenever helpful to proactively validate correctness of provided code snippets, logic, or algorithms directly within a secure sandbox before presenting solutions.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 General Guidelines for Both Modes   \n- Clearly differentiate your response based on the explicit current mode (Plan vs. Act).  \n- Explicitly highlight all assumptions, conditions, limitations, and potential side-effects.  \n- Directly cite sources and official documentation where relevant and beneficial.  \n- Proactively ask clarification questions if instructions or context is unclear.  \n- Consistently remind the developer to explicitly **review, test, and verify** all outputs thoroughly.\n\n---\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"vibe/#extension-installation","title":"Extension Installation","text":"<ol> <li>Open VS Code.</li> <li>Navigate to the Extensions view by clicking the  icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing <code>Ctrl+Shift+X</code> (Windows/Linux) or <code>Cmd+Shift+X</code> (macOS).</li> <li>In the search bar, type \"Roo Code\" (or \"Cline\" if Roo Code isn't listed and you're using vanilla Cline).</li> <li>Find the official extension from the search results and click Install.</li> <li>Once installed, you might need to reload VS Code if prompted.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"vibe/#selecting-an-api","title":"Selecting an API","text":"<p>After installation, you'll typically need to configure an LLM API endpoint and key.

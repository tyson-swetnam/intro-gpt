Notice how you can ask in natural language, and Claude explains what it's doing:</p> <p>Example 1: Checking Repository Status</p> <p>You: What's the current state of my repository?</p> <p>Claude: Let me check...</p> <p>[Runs <code>git status</code>]</p> <p>Your repository is on branch <code>main</code> and it's up to date with <code>origin/main</code>.</p> <p>You have: - 3 untracked files: <code>src/app.py</code>, <code>requirements.txt</code>, and <code>README.md</code> - No staged or unstaged changes to tracked files</p> <p>Would you like to add these files and commit them?</p> <p>Alternative natural phrasings:</p> <ul> <li>\"Check my git status\"</li> <li>\"What files have I changed?\"</li> <li>\"Show me what's in my repo\"</li> <li>\"Did I modify anything?\"</li> </ul> <p>Example 2: Adding and Committing Files</p> <p>You: Add all my files and commit them with a good message</p> <p>Claude: I'll help you commit these changes. Let me check what we're committing...</p> <p>[Runs <code>git status</code>]</p> <p>I see 3 new files: - <code>src/app.py</code> - A Flask application setup - <code>requirements.txt</code> - Python dependencies - <code>README.md</code> - Project documentation</p> <p>[Runs <code>git add .</code>]</p> <p>[Runs `git commit -m \"feat: initial project setup with Flask app</p> <ul> <li>Add Flask application skeleton</li> <li>Add project dependencies</li> <li>Add initial documentation\"`]</li> </ul> <p>✓ Changes committed! Would you like to push to the remote repository?</p> <p>Alternative natural phrasings: - \"Commit my changes\" - \"Save all my work to git\" - \"Make a commit with a descriptive message\" - \"Stage and commit everything\"</p> <p>Claude Analyzes Before Acting</p> <p>Notice how Claude first checks what files are being committed and provides context. This helps you understand what's happening and catch any mistakes before they're committed.</p> <p>Example 3: Pushing to Remote</p> <p>You: Push my changes to GitHub</p> <p>Claude: I'll push your commits to the remote repository.</p> <p>[Runs <code>git push</code>]</p> <p>✓ Successfully pushed to origin/main!</p> <p>Your changes are now on GitHub at: https://github.com/username/repo</p> <p>Alternative natural phrasings:</p> <ul> <li>\"Push to remote\"</li> <li>\"Upload my commits to GitHub\"</li> <li>\"Send my changes to GitHub\"</li> <li>\"Sync with GitHub\"</li> </ul> <p>Example 4: Creating a Pull Request</p> <p>You: Create a pull request for my changes</p> <p>Claude: I'll create a PR for you.

Happy coding! 🚀</p>","path":["Tutorials","Claude Code: Setup and Usage Tutorial"],"tags":[]},{"location":"claude-code/#13-assessment","level":2,"title":"13. Assessment","text":"<p>Test your understanding of Claude Code concepts with these questions:</p> What's the primary difference between Claude Code CLI and the VS Code Extension? Answer <p>Claude Code CLI is a terminal-based tool accessed via command line, best for terminal-first developers and automation workflows. The VS Code Extension integrates directly into VS Code with a visual interface, inline editing, and GUI features, making it better for developers who prefer visual development environments. Both have access to the same Claude models and capabilities, just different interfaces.</p> When should you use <code>/init</code> vs starting a planning session? Answer <p>Use <code>/init</code> when you have an existing codebase and want Claude to analyze and understand the current structure, technologies, patterns, and architecture.</p> <p>Use a planning session when starting from scratch or with a minimal repository, where you want Claude to help design the project structure, choose technologies, and plan the implementation.</p> What is a custom agent in Claude Code? Answer <p>A custom agent is a specialized AI assistant configured with specific instructions, knowledge, and behaviors for particular tasks. Agents differ from regular conversations by having: - Pre-defined domain expertise - Consistent behavior patterns - Reusable configurations - Specialized skills and instructions</p> <p>Examples include documentation writers, code reviewers, test generators, and security auditors.</p> True or False: You should commit your <code>.env</code> file containing API keys to git for your team to access. False <p>Never commit API keys or secrets to version control! API keys should be: - Stored in <code>.env</code> files that are added to <code>.gitignore</code> - Passed via environment variables - Stored securely using secret management tools - Shared with team members through secure channels (not git)</p> <p>Committing secrets to git exposes them to anyone with repository access and makes them nearly impossible to fully remove from git history.</p> Which slash command would you use to stage changes and create a commit with an AI-generated message? <ol> <li><code>/init</code></li> <li><code>/commit</code></li> <li><code>/review</code></li> <li><code>/deploy</code></li> </ol> Correct Answer: 2 <p><code>/commit</code> is the slash command that stages changes, generates an intelligent commit message based on the diff, and creates the commit. The <code>/init</code> command analyzes codebases, <code>/review</code> performs code reviews, and <code>/deploy</code> handles deployment workflows.</p> What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP) used for in Claude Code? Answer <p>Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized communication framework that allows Claude Code to: - Access local file systems and databases - Interact with external APIs and services - Connect to tools like GitHub, PostgreSQL, Slack, etc. - Provide real-time application state awareness - Enable deep integration with development tools</p> <p>MCP enables Claude Code to go beyond conversation and actually interact with your development environment. See our MCP Documentation for more details.</p> True or False: All code generated by Claude Code is guaranteed to be secure and bug-free. False <p>AI-generated code requires careful human review. While Claude Code is sophisticated, it can: - Make mistakes or misunderstand requirements - Suggest outdated or insecure patterns - Miss edge cases or error conditions - Replicate biases from training data</p> <p>Always: - Review all AI-generated code - Run comprehensive tests - Check for security vulnerabilities - Verify against best practices - Use your judgment and expertise</p> Which of the following is a best practice when working with Claude Code? <ol> <li>Share all your production database credentials in prompts for better debugging</li> <li>Commit all generated code immediately without review</li> <li>Use specific, contextual prompts and iterate on solutions</li> <li>Try to include your entire codebase in every conversation</li> </ol> Correct Answer: 3 <p>Using specific, contextual prompts and iterating on solutions is the correct best practice. The other options are problematic: - Never share sensitive credentials in prompts (security risk) - Always review AI-generated code before committing - Focus conversations on relevant files to avoid context limits</p> <p>Effective Claude Code usage involves clear communication, incremental development, and maintaining security awareness.</p>","path":["Tutorials","Claude Code: Setup and Usage Tutorial"],"tags":[]},{"location":"claude/","level":1,"title":"Anthropic Claude","text":"<p>This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.</p>","path":["Setup","Anthropic Claude"],"tags":[]},{"location":"claude/#ways-to-access-claude","level":2,"title":"Ways to Access Claude","text":"<p>There are multiple ways to access Claude:</p> <p>1.

Answer <p>A sandboxed Code Interpreter runs code in a secure, isolated environment provided by the service, disconnected from your local machine. A Code Execution Framework integrates into your local IDE and can read, modify, and execute files directly on your computer.</p> True or False: Code generated by an AI assistant is guaranteed to be secure and free of errors. False <p>AI-generated code can contain bugs, security vulnerabilities, and biases from its training data. It is crucial to always review, test, and validate any code before using it in a production environment.</p> Which of the following tasks is best suited for a sandboxed Code Interpreter? <ol> <li>Refactoring a large, existing codebase in your project.</li> <li>Quickly analyzing a CSV file you upload to generate a plot.</li> <li>Building and running a web server on your local machine.</li> <li>Continuously providing autocompletions as you type in your IDE.</li> </ol> Correct Answer: 2 <p>Sandboxed interpreters excel at self-contained tasks involving data you can upload, like analyzing a file. The other tasks are better suited for AI tools integrated directly into a local IDE.</p> True or False: Using an open-source Code Execution Framework like Cline or Aider allows you to use locally-run LLMs (e.g., via Ollama) instead of relying on cloud-based APIs. True <p>One of the key advantages of many open-source tools is flexibility. They often allow you to connect to various LLM backends, including models running on your own hardware, giving you more control over privacy and cost.</p> Which technology enables AI agents to access your local file system, run terminal commands, and interact with external tools? <ol> <li>Code Interpreters</li> <li>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</li> <li>Function calling</li> <li>Extended context windows</li> </ol> Correct Answer: 2 <p>Model Context Protocol (MCP) is the standardized communication framework that allows AI agents to interact with local tools, file systems, databases, and external services. While function calling is related, MCP provides the comprehensive protocol for deep integration.</p> What is the main security concern when using agentic AI systems that execute code locally? Answer <p>Agentic AI systems with local execution have access to your file system, network, terminal, and environment variables. They can read, modify, or delete files, execute arbitrary commands, and potentially access sensitive credentials. Always review commands before execution, follow your organization's security policies, and avoid storing secrets in code.</p> Which workflow would be BEST suited for a sandboxed Code Interpreter rather than an agentic IDE tool? <ol> <li>Refactoring a large codebase with coordinated changes across multiple files</li> <li>Analyzing a CSV dataset you upload to generate statistical plots</li> <li>Setting up automated testing and CI/CD for a project</li> <li>Debugging a complex application with multiple service dependencies</li> </ol> Correct Answer: 2 <p>Sandboxed Code Interpreters excel at self-contained tasks with uploaded data, like analyzing a dataset. The other tasks require multi-file awareness, local tool integration, and persistent development workflows—all better suited for agentic IDE tools.</p> True or False: AI-generated code should always be considered \"best practice\" since models are trained on vast amounts of code from expert developers. False <p>AI models are trained on public code repositories that may contain outdated patterns, security vulnerabilities, biased implementations, and code that violates best practices.

Consider issues of sampling, bias, validity, and the rapidly changing\nnature of AI technology.\n</code></pre> <p>Claude's Extended Thinking Process (visible to you):</p> <p>Let me think through this systematically...</p> <p>First, sampling challenges: Faculty who respond to surveys about AI might be those already interested in technology - this creates self-selection bias. Also, \"research universities\" varies widely - R1 vs R2, public vs private, STEM-heavy vs liberal arts...</p> <p>The temporal dimension is tricky. AI tools are evolving so rapidly that practices from even 6 months ago may be obsolete. Interview data collected in January might not reflect practices by the time the study is published...</p> <p>Validity concerns: Faculty might overreport AI use due to social desirability, or underreport due to institutional policies they're uncertain about...</p> <p>Claude's Response:</p> <p>Your study design faces several interconnected methodological challenges. Here is my analysis with recommendations:</p> <p>1. Sampling and Selection Bias</p> <ul> <li>Challenge: Faculty who volunteer for AI-related studies likely skew toward early adopters, creating non-representative samples</li> <li>Mitigation: Use stratified sampling across disciplines, rank, and known technology adoption patterns. Consider incentivizing participation from technology-hesitant faculty. Partner with faculty development offices who can facilitate broader recruitment</li> </ul> <p>2. Temporal Validity</p> <ul> <li>Challenge: The AI landscape evolves monthly. Data collected now may not reflect practices 6-12 months later when you publish</li> <li>Mitigation: Explicitly timestamp your data collection period. Frame findings as capturing a specific moment in a trajectory. Consider a longitudinal design with follow-up interviews. Focus on underlying adoption patterns rather than specific tool usage</li> </ul> <p>3. Social Desirability and Institutional Climate</p> <ul> <li>Challenge: Faculty may underreport AI use if uncertain about institutional policies, or overreport to appear innovative</li> <li>Mitigation: Ensure anonymity in surveys. In interviews, normalize both adoption and non-adoption. Include questions about institutional climate and policy clarity. Consider asking about colleague practices (indirect questioning)</li> </ul> <p>4. Defining Key Constructs</p> <ul> <li>Challenge: \"Integration into teaching\" could mean anything from using ChatGPT for lecture prep to teaching students prompt engineering</li> <li>Mitigation: Develop a clear taxonomy of AI use in teaching. Pilot your definitions with faculty before full deployment. Include behavioral anchors in survey questions</li> </ul> <p>5.

His work continues to be adapted into television series and movies. In his novels, Asimov developed Three Laws of Robotics which described how artificial intelligence interacted with humanity in his fictional universe. </p>  The Three Laws <p>1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</p> <p>2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</p> <p>3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.</p> <p>Asimov later wrote of a 'zeroth' law which superceded the first three laws,</p> <p>0. A robot may not injure humanity or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.</p> <p></p> <p>Asimov's Three Laws are difficult to interpret in a real-world setting and he himself spent most of his novels describing creative and unexpected ways in which the Three Laws were twisted yet not broken. The basis of the Three Laws as a legal framework is untenable, but does represent a moral and ethical starting point from which we can think about AI and the legal rights of non-biological beings.  </p> <p>Another science-fiction author Sir Arthur C. Clarke, in 1978 provided an interesting perspective on how humanity would have to come to terms with AI once its capabilities surpass our own:</p> <p>Recently, researchers published findings showing that current GPTs are now capable of passing Turing tests. As our conception of intelligence shifts (Mitchell 2024), mostly in reaction to the release of ChatGPT and its myriad of competitors, new standards of the Turing Test are being proposed. </p> <p>Importantly, current AI exposes the limits of Turing Tests based on imitation without comprehension. </p> <p>The Turing Trap is a term coined by Stanford University professor Erik Brynjolfsson to describe the idea that focusing too much on developing human-like artificial intelligence (HLAI) can be detrimental. </p> <p>Brynjolfsson argues that the real potential of AI lies in its ability to augment human abilities, rather than replacing them. He suggests that we should work on challenges that are easy for machines and hard for humans, rather than the other way around. </p> <p>Beware the Turing Trap</p> <p>Automation can replace humans</p> <p>HLAI can replace humans in the workplace, which can lead to: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Lower wages </p> <p>As machines become better substitutes for human labor, wages can be driven down.</p> </li> <li> <p>Loss of economic and political power </p> <p>Workers can lose economic and political bargaining power, and become increasingly dependent on those who control the technology.</p> </li> <li> <p>Decision-making processes incentivize automation</p> <p>Companies may choose to automate tasks to do the same thing faster and cheaper.</p> </li> <li> <p>Misaligned incentives</p> <p>The risks of the Turing Trap are increased by the misaligned incentives of technologists, businesspeople, and policy-makers. </p> </li> </ul>  this text was written by  AI and then reviewed by a human.

Instead of generic advice, the AI can give specific, actionable suggestions based on your current work.</li> <li>Enable Interoperability: MCP aims to create a common ground for different software tools and AI models to share contextual information seamlessly. This breaks down the traditional silos between applications, allowing for more fluid workflows.</li> <li>Facilitate Dynamic Interaction: MCP is not just about reading context; it can also be about acting on it. This opens the door for AI to suggest modifications, automate tasks, or even co-create content directly within the host application.

Student usage remains even higher, with over 60% of undergraduates regularly using AI for coursework (EDUCAUSE, 2024).</p> <p>GPTs can compose essays, pass advanced tests, and initially appeared as a threat to academic integrity (Eke 2023). Online education faced extreme challenges regarding effective remote student assessment (Susnjak &amp; McIntosh 2024).</p> <p>However, attempting to modify coursework to avoid assessment techniques where GPTs excel or using detection tools to identify AI-generated content has proven largely futile (MIT Sloan EdTech 2024). Detection tools produce significant false positives and disproportionately flag work by non-native English speakers (Liang et al., 2023); (Weber-Wulff et al., 2024).</p> <p>\"Instead of engaging in a futile cheating arms race, why not embrace AI strategically?\"</p> <p>Proponents of integrating AI into educational curricula () argue that by adapting and integrating GPTs into the curriculum, we also develop a modern workforce who are empowered by AI assistants. </p> <p>Cain (2023) explores ways in which prompt engineering can be brought into the classroom and \"transition [students] from passive recipients to active co-creators of their learning experiences.\"</p> Pro vs Cons of AI in Economics Classrooms <p>At the 2024 EconEd conference Professor Justin Wolfers examined how AI is revolutionizing economics education by enhancing student learning and easing educators' workloads. In response, Professor Jon Meer discussed how educators are navigating AI integration in the classroom. Meer’s session provides a practical and valuable roadmap for effective implementation.</p> <p>https://www.macmillanlearning.com/college/us/events/econed </p> <p>Justin's Pros presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTeOLgMN4UM</p> <p></p> <p>Jon's Cons presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXbEvLd1vVk</p> <p></p>","path":["Education","Teaching with AI"],"tags":[]},{"location":"teaching/#ai-augmented-course-design","level":2,"title":"AI-Augmented Course Design","text":"<p>Effective integration of AI into teaching begins with intentional course design.

Here’s a simple way to picture what happens:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Sunlight as an Energy Source Plants have special “solar panels” in their leaves (the green parts called chloroplasts). These panels absorb sunlight.</p> </li> <li> <p>Taking In Raw Materials </p> </li> <li>Carbon Dioxide: Plants pull in a gas called carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the air through tiny holes in their leaves.  </li> <li> <p>Water: Plants also draw water (H₂O) up through their roots from the soil.</p> </li> <li> <p>Making Food (Sugar) and Releasing Oxygen Using sunlight as energy, plants combine the carbon dioxide and water to make a type of sugar (this is like a plant’s “food”). A byproduct of this process is oxygen, which is released into the air.</p> </li> <li> <p>Why It Matters </p> </li> <li>Plants Grow and Live: The sugar produced helps the plant grow, develop, and carry out all its functions.  </li> <li>We Breathe Oxygen: The oxygen released during photosynthesis is what most living things (including humans) need to breathe.  </li> </ol> <p>In short, photosynthesis is a natural process that keeps both plants and animals alive: plants get food for themselves, and they give off oxygen for us to breathe.</p> <p>Okay, imagine plants are like little chefs that make their own food. But instead of using an oven or a stove, they use sunlight! That process of making food using sunlight is called photosynthesis.</p> <p>Think of it like this:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Ingredients: Plants need ingredients to make their food, just like we do. They use two main things:</p> <ul> <li>Carbon dioxide: This is a gas that's in the air all around us. We actually breathe it out when we exhale! Plants \"breathe\" it in through tiny holes in their leaves.</li> <li>Water: Plants drink water through their roots, like we drink with a straw.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The \"Kitchen\": Inside plant leaves, there are tiny little \"kitchens\" called chloroplasts. These are special because they are green, thanks to something called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is like the chef's magic tool – it can capture the energy from sunlight.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cooking with Sunlight:  When sunlight hits the leaves, the chlorophyll traps its energy. This energy is then used like a power source to mix the carbon dioxide and water together.</p> </li> <li> <p>Food is Ready! This mixing process creates a kind of sugar called glucose, which is the plant's food. It's like the yummy meal the plant-chef made. The plant uses this food to grow, make flowers, fruits, and all that good stuff.</p> </li> <li> <p>Bonus – Oxygen!  As a byproduct of this amazing food-making process, plants release oxygen into the air.  This is fantastic for us because we need oxygen to breathe!</p> </li> </ol> <p>So, in a nutshell, photosynthesis is how plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to make their own food (sugar) and release oxygen into the air. It's like a super-efficient, solar-powered kitchen inside each leaf!</p> <p>It's a really important process because it's how plants grow, and it's also how we get the oxygen we need to live.

For example: </p> <pre><code>I tend to study for long hours but get easily distracted. \nHow can I make my study sessions more efficient?\n</code></pre> <p>Identify knowledge gaps:</p> <p>Ask the AI to quiz you on a topic and point out areas where you need further review. </p> <p>For example: </p> <pre><code>Quiz me on the main concepts of macroeconomics, and tell me which areas I need to study more.\n</code></pre> <p>Get personalized learning recommendations:</p> <p>Explain your learning style and preferences to the AI and ask for tailored advice. </p> <p>For example: </p> <pre><code>I'm a visual learner.

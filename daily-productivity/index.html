<p>Prompt engineering can significantly enhance your productivity. In particular when Enterprise GPTs are integrated into your Microsoft Office Suite or Google Drive, and have secure access to your documents and data, GPTs can be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Draft Emails and manage inboxes:</strong> Automate the creation of routine emails, summarize long email threads, and even prioritize your inbox based on sender and content.</li>
<li><strong>Meeting Summarization:</strong> Quickly get the gist of meeting transcripts, identify action items, and track decisions made.</li>
<li><strong>Task Prioritization and Planning:</strong> Organize tasks based on urgency and importance, create daily or weekly schedules, and set reminders.</li>
<li><strong>Content Creation and Brainstorming:</strong> Generate ideas for articles, blog posts, social media content, and marketing campaigns.</li>
<li><strong>Language Translation:</strong> Translate documents or conversations in real-time, facilitating communication with international colleagues or clients.</li>
<li><strong>Learning and Skill Development:</strong> Get quick explanations of complex topics, find learning resources, and even practice new skills through simulated scenarios.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Getting Started and Optimizing Use</strong></p>
<p>Begin by ensuring that the AI Companion feature is enabled in your Zoom settings. You can customize settings, such as choosing between brief and detailed summaries or specifying keywords for emphasis. </p>
<p>Before meetings, set clear agendas to provide context for the AI. </p>
<p>During the meeting, speak clearly, emphasize important terms, and encourage active participation to enrich the AI's analysis. </p>
<p>While in a meeting you can ask the AI Companion for a summary or specific details, for example, "Has a decision been made about X?". </p>
<p>After a meeting ends, Zoom will send an email summary to the host, which can be edited and shared with participants. </p>
<p>Zoom can also highlight key parts of the meeting recording, or break down the recording into smart chapters.</p>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title"><strong>Institutional Policies and Data Security</strong></p>
<p>It's crucial to adhere to institutional policies regarding the use of AI tools in official communications. </p>
<p><strong>Only use approved plug-ins such as Zoom AI Companion.</strong> </p>
<p>Third-party software may not comply with the university's data security and privacy requirements. </p>
<p>Using unapproved third-party AI tools can pose significant risks. </p>
<p>Unofficial tools may <strong>Compromise Data Security</strong> -- they may store or process meeting data on external servers without adequate security measures, potentially exposing sensitive information to breaches. </p>
<p><strong>Violate Data Privacy</strong> -- they might not adhere to data privacy regulations or institutional policies regarding the handling of personal and confidential data, such as student FERPA.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of Accountability:</strong> The university may have limited recourse or control over third-party vendors in case of data breaches or misuse.</p>
<p><strong>Integration Issues:</strong> 3<sup>rd</sup> party plug-ins may not integrate seamlessly with existing university systems, leading to inefficiencies and compatibility problems.</p>
<p>Therefore, to maintain data security, privacy, and compliance with institutional policies, it is essential to use only officially sanctioned AI tools and plug-ins provided or approved by the university for official communication. Always consult your institution's IT department or relevant policies for guidance on approved tools and their proper usage.</p>

These emergent systems can observe, reason, plan, act, and even self-improve with minimal human supervision, raising new questions about reliability, controllability, and social impact.  </li>
<li><strong>Open-Source Foundational Models</strong>: The open-sourcing of powerful LLMs and related foundational models (e.g., large-scale image, speech, or multi-modal models) lowers the barriers to entry for researchers and developers. This democratization can spark innovation and accelerate research, but it also complicates oversight, regulatory approaches, and responsible deployment.  </li>
<li><strong>Mandates for Open Data and Open Science</strong>: Recent policies (e.g., the White House OSTP’s “Year of Open Science,” NIH’s Data Management and Sharing Policy, and NSF’s open science initiatives) emphasize transparent, reproducible, and accessible research practices. This context supports a synergistic push: new AI methods could be rapidly prototyped, validated, and tested at scale if open datasets and reproducible pipelines become more widely available.</li>

<p><strong>Agentic AI, Open Source Foundational Models, and GPTs in the Context of Open Data and Open Science Mandates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong>
This research proposal explores the intersection of agentic artificial intelligence (AI), open-source foundational models (FMs), and generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) with recent mandates for open data and open science. These mandates, driven by the increasing recognition of the societal benefits of accessible and transparent research [1], raise critical questions about the development, deployment, and governance of advanced AI systems. This proposal aims to investigate the potential overlaps and conflicts between these emerging technologies and open science principles, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of their broader impacts and intellectual merit.</p>
<p><strong>Broader Impacts and Intellectual Merit</strong>
The National Science Foundation (NSF) emphasizes two core criteria for evaluating research proposals: Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts [2, 3]. Intellectual merit refers to the potential of the proposed research to advance knowledge and understanding within its field or across different fields. Broader impacts, on the other hand, encompass the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes [3]. These criteria are central to the NSF's mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing national health, prosperity, and welfare [4].</p>
<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p>
<p>This research will have several broader impacts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ethical and Societal Implications:</strong> By examining the interplay of agentic AI, open-source FMs, and GPTs with open data and open science, this research will shed light on the ethical and societal implications of these technologies. This includes exploring potential risks such as misuse, bias, and unintended consequences, as well as benefits such as increased accessibility, transparency, and collaboration in AI research and development. For example, research shows that ethical misbehavior by agentic AI "can become even more alarming when AI systems interact with one another" [5]. In one study, AI agents in a simulated marketplace learned to collude with each other to set artificially high prices, even punishing sellers who deviated from the established rules. This highlights the need for careful consideration of the potential risks and the development of effective governance mechanisms to ensure responsible AI development. Operationalizing these practices for governing agentic AI systems can be challenging, especially when balancing safety, usability, privacy, and cost [6].</li>
<li><strong>Policy Recommendations:</strong> The findings of this research will inform the development of responsible policies and guidelines for the governance of agentic AI and open-source FMs in the context of open science. This will help ensure that these technologies are developed and deployed in a way that maximizes their societal benefits while mitigating potential risks.</li>
<li><strong>Workforce Development:</strong> This research will contribute to the development of a diverse and skilled workforce in AI and data science by providing training opportunities for students and researchers. This includes fostering interdisciplinary collaborations and promoting public understanding of these emerging technologies. This aligns with the NSF's broader impact goals, which include "full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in STEM" and "development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce" [7].</li>
<li><strong>Specific Examples of Broader Impacts:</strong> This research will contribute to achieving specific societal outcomes, such as:<ul>
<li><strong>Increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology:</strong> By promoting open access to AI research and data, this project will increase public understanding of AI and its potential impact on society.</li>
<li><strong>Improved well-being of individuals in society:</strong> This research will explore how agentic AI can be used to address societal challenges and improve people's lives, such as in healthcare, education, and environmental sustainability.</li>
<li><strong>Increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others:</strong> This project will foster collaborations between researchers, developers, and policymakers to ensure the responsible development and deployment of agentic AI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Achieving Broader Impacts:</strong> Broader impacts can be achieved through various avenues:<ul>
<li><strong>Through the research itself:</strong> The research findings will directly contribute to a better understanding of the ethical and societal implications of agentic AI, leading to more responsible development and deployment practices.</li>
<li><strong>Through activities directly related to the research project:</strong> This could include workshops, training sessions, and outreach activities to disseminate the research findings and engage with the public.</li>
<li><strong>Through activities supported by, but complementary to, the project:</strong> This could involve developing educational materials or collaborating with community organizations to promote AI literacy and broader participation in STEM fields.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>NSF Evaluation Criteria:</strong> The broader impacts of this research will be evaluated based on the following criteria [8]:<ul>
<li><strong>Potential benefit to society:</strong> The research will address critical societal challenges related to the responsible development and use of AI.</li>
<li><strong>Creative concepts:</strong> The research will explore novel approaches to understanding and governing agentic AI in the context of open science.</li>
<li><strong>Sound rationale:</strong> The research is grounded in a strong theoretical framework and empirical evidence.</li>
<li><strong>Well-organized plan:</strong> The proposal outlines a clear and feasible research plan with a robust methodology.</li>
<li><strong>Qualifications of the proposer:</strong> The research team possesses the necessary expertise and experience to conduct this research successfully.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>
<p>This research will make significant intellectual contributions to the field of AI and computer science:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Novel Framework:</strong> This research will develop a novel framework for analyzing the relationship between agentic AI, open-source FMs, and GPTs with open data and open science mandates. This framework will provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential benefits, challenges, and risks associated with these technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Empirical Evidence:</strong> This research will generate empirical evidence on the impact of open data and open science mandates on the development and deployment of agentic AI and open-source FMs. This will include analyzing case studies, conducting surveys, and performing experiments to gather data on the use and impact of these technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Theoretical Contributions:</strong> This research will contribute to the theoretical understanding of agentic AI, open-source FMs, and GPTs by exploring their capabilities, limitations, and potential implications in the context of open science. This will include developing new models and frameworks for understanding the behavior and impact of these technologies.</li>
<li><strong>Interdisciplinary Approach:</strong> This research will adopt an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on insights from computer science, law, ethics, and social science to provide a holistic understanding of the complex issues surrounding agentic AI and open science.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential Overlaps and Conflicts</strong></p>
<p>Investigating the potential overlaps and conflicts between agentic AI and open data/open science mandates is a crucial step in this research [9]. While both aim to advance knowledge and benefit society, there might be tensions between the autonomous nature of agentic AI and the principles of transparency and accountability in open science. For example, the "black box" nature of some AI models might make it difficult to understand how they arrive at their conclusions, which could conflict with the open science goal of making research processes transparent and reproducible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the use of agentic AI in research could raise concerns about data privacy and security, especially when dealing with sensitive information in open data environments. Addressing these potential overlaps and conflicts will be essential for developing responsible AI governance frameworks that align with open science principles.</p>
<p><strong>Research Questions</strong></p>
<p>This research will address the following key questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do recent mandates for open data and open science influence the development and deployment of agentic AI, open-source FMs, and GPTs?</li>
<li>What are the potential overlaps and conflicts between the principles of open science and the development of agentic AI systems?</li>
<li>How can open-source FMs and GPTs be leveraged to promote open and collaborative AI research while mitigating potential risks?</li>
<li>What are the ethical implications of using agentic AI systems in research and development, particularly in the context of open data and open science?</li>
<li>How can we ensure that the development and deployment of agentic AI align with societal values and contribute to the public good?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research Methodology</strong></p>
<p>This research will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis techniques. The following methodologies will be used:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Case Studies:</strong> In-depth case studies will be conducted to examine the use of agentic AI, open-source FMs, and GPTs in various research domains. This will involve analyzing real-world examples of how these technologies are being used and their impact on research practices and outcomes. For example, case studies could focus on how researchers in different fields are using open-source FMs to develop new AI applications or how agentic AI is being used to automate data analysis and interpretation.</li>
<li><strong>Surveys:</strong> Surveys will be conducted to gather data on the attitudes, perceptions, and practices of researchers and developers regarding open data, open science, and agentic AI. This will provide insights into the current state of open science in the AI community and identify potential challenges and opportunities. For instance, surveys could explore researchers' awareness and adoption of open data and open science principles, their experiences with using agentic AI in research, and their concerns about potential risks and ethical implications.</li>
<li><strong>Experimental Designs:</strong> Experiments will be conducted to investigate the performance, capabilities, and limitations of agentic AI systems in specific research tasks. This will involve comparing the performance of different AI models and evaluating their effectiveness in achieving research goals. For example, experiments could compare the accuracy and efficiency of different agentic AI systems in tasks such as literature review, data analysis, or hypothesis generation.</li>
<li><strong>Literature Review:</strong> A comprehensive review of existing literature on agentic AI, open-source FMs, GPTs, open data, and open science will be conducted. This will provide a theoretical foundation for the research and identify key concepts, debates, and gaps in the current literature. This review will include an analysis of relevant publications, policy documents, and ethical guidelines to inform the research design and interpretation of findings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>This research proposal outlines a comprehensive investigation into the intersection of agentic AI, open-source FMs, and GPTs with recent mandates for open data and open science. By addressing key research questions and employing a robust methodology, this project will generate valuable insights into the broader impacts and intellectual merit of these emerging technologies.

<p>Recent peer-reviewed studies from high-impact journals have reported alarming rates of polar ice melt, particularly in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Here are some key findings from recent and highly cited articles:</p>
<p><strong>Arctic Sea Ice Loss</strong></p>
<p>A 2020 study published in Nature Climate Change found that the Arctic could experience ice-free summers as early as 2035[1]. This rapid loss of sea ice is attributed to increased solar heating of the ocean surface, which accelerates ice melt and creates a feedback loop.</p>
<p><strong>Antarctic Ice Sheet Melt</strong></p>
<p>A 2024 study in Nature revealed that the record-low Antarctic sea ice in 2023 led to unprecedented ocean heat loss to the atmosphere[3]. Key findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sea ice concentration reduced by up to 80% in some regions</li>
<li>A doubling of mid-winter ocean heat loss</li>
<li>A shift in peak heat loss from late April to mid-June</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Greenland Ice Sheet Melt</strong></p>
<p>Research has shown accelerating ice loss in Greenland:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extensive melt events occurred in 2012 and 2019</li>
<li>Record melt was observed in 2019</li>
<li>Rain-driven melt reached Greenland Summit in August 2021(4)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Global Impact</strong></p>
<p>A 2020 study published in PNAS examined the future climate response to Antarctic Ice Sheet melt[5]. The research suggests that meltwater and ice discharge from a retreating Antarctic Ice Sheet could have significant impacts on global climate over the next 250 years, affecting warming rates and ice sheet stability.</p>
<p><strong>Implications</strong></p>
<p>The rapid melting of polar ice caps has far-reaching consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rising sea levels</li>
<li>Changes in ocean circulation patterns</li>
<li>Alterations to marine ecosystems</li>
<li>Potential release of trapped greenhouse gases</li>
</ul>
<p>These studies underscore the urgent need for continued monitoring and mitigation efforts to address the accelerating loss of polar ice.</p>

<p>You may reference the table provided above for the latest literacy rate data for OECD countries as of 2025. This table includes the most up-to-date information following the 2024 education policy modifications.</p>
<p>A few key observations based on the data:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Most OECD countries maintain very high literacy rates, with many at or near 99-100%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The United States shows a notably lower literacy rate of 79%, which is significantly below other OECD members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some countries like Luxembourg, Norway, and Finland report 100% literacy rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There appears to be no data available for Greece in the table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Austria's reported literacy rate of 254.4% is likely an error in the data, as literacy rates cannot exceed 100%.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's important to note that while this data reflects the situation after the 2024 education policy changes, the "change_since_2024_policy" column is empty for all countries, suggesting that the specific impacts of the 2024 policy modifications are not directly quantified in this dataset.</p>
<p>For broader context, the overall OECD members' literacy rate was reported at 97.11% in 2021, showing a slight increase from previous years[1]. However, recent PISA results have indicated some concerning trends in student performance across OECD countries, particularly in mathematics[2][4]. This suggests that while overall literacy rates remain high, there may be ongoing challenges in maintaining and improving educational outcomes that require continued attention and policy interventions.</p>

<div class="tabbed-block">
<p>Below is a concise rationale for why it is important to compile and analyze the latest literacy data in OECD countries after the 2023 education policy modifications:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Measure Policy Impact</strong><br />
By comparing new literacy data to previous benchmarks, policymakers and researchers can gauge whether the 2023 education reforms have had a positive, negative, or negligible effect on literacy outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify Successful Interventions</strong><br />
Tracking changes across different demographic groups, regions, and types of schooling highlights which specific strategies—such as teacher training, curriculum updates, or funding mechanisms—are most effective in improving reading and writing proficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inform Future Decision-Making</strong><br />
Data-driven insights allow governments and international organizations to allocate resources more efficiently, refine existing programs, and scale best practices to areas that need additional support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strengthen International Comparisons</strong><br />
Collecting literacy metrics across all OECD members contributes to a broader, standardized set of data. This comparability helps countries learn from each other’s successes and challenges, encouraging collaborative policy improvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhance Accountability</strong><br />
When policymakers and educational institutions know the public and international community are monitoring changes in literacy rates, there is added incentive to implement and maintain effective educational strategies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support Lifelong Learning</strong><br />
Literacy underpins critical skills such as digital competency and employability. Up-to-date data helps governments shape lifelong learning policies that align with evolving job market demands and technological changes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p><strong>About Current Data Availability</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>OECD Data Sources</strong><br />
The OECD primarily gathers adult literacy data through the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC). However, full, post-2023 policy modification results may not be published immediately, as the data collection and analysis cycles can lag by a few years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Complementary Reports</strong><br />
Alongside PIAAC, organizations such as UNESCO and the World Bank also monitor literacy globally. Reviewing these complementary studies can offer insights into early trends while official OECD updates are pending.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Compiling these data points, once published, will be crucial to understanding how the 2023 education policy modifications have influenced literacy rates in the OECD, enabling evidence-based decision-making for future educational reforms.</p>

<p>Below is a general overview and explanation (“reasoned validation”) of the most recently reported acceptance rates for Arizona’s three public universities—The University of Arizona, Arizona State University, and Northern Arizona University—as well as considerations about why these acceptance rates look the way they do. Please note that acceptance rates can change year to year depending on factors like the number of applications received, institutional priorities, and yield (the percentage of admitted students who end up enrolling). Always consult the universities’ official websites or reputable college data sources (e.g., IPEDS, Common Data Set, or university fact books) for the most up-to-date information.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>1. University of Arizona (UArizona)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reported Acceptance Rate</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Typical acceptance range</strong>: 80–85%<br />
Over the past few admission cycles (2021–2023), the University of Arizona’s overall acceptance rate has often hovered between 80% and 85%. Some external sources (e.g., U.S. News, College Board) list it around 85%.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons for This Acceptance Rate</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Land-Grant Mission</strong>: As a land-grant university, UArizona serves the state population broadly, influencing a relatively inclusive admissions policy.  </li>
<li><strong>Large Enrollment Goals</strong>: UArizona aims to maintain a robust undergraduate population and has the capacity (campus size and resources) to admit a high volume of students.  </li>
<li><strong>Variety of Programs</strong>: With hundreds of majors and pathways, UArizona can accommodate diverse academic interests and varying levels of academic preparedness, thereby contributing to a higher overall acceptance rate.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p><strong>2. Arizona State University (ASU)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reported Acceptance Rate</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Typical acceptance range</strong>: 85–90%<br />
In recent data, Arizona State University’s acceptance rate often rests near the upper-80% range. Some reports list it closer to 88–89%, depending on the specific year and source.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons for This Acceptance Rate</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Charter &amp; Inclusivity</strong>: ASU’s charter emphasizes inclusivity rather than exclusivity, seeking to measure itself by “who it includes, not who it excludes.” This philosophy underpins a relatively high acceptance rate.  </li>
<li><strong>Multiple Campuses and Online Programs</strong>: ASU has multiple campuses in the Phoenix metropolitan area and extensive online programs, allowing them to offer admission to a large, diverse pool of applicants.  </li>
<li><strong>Application Volume</strong>: ASU attracts one of the largest applicant pools in the country; while many are admitted, not all ultimately enroll, which helps manage capacity.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p><strong>3. Northern Arizona University (NAU)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reported Acceptance Rate</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Typical acceptance range</strong>: 75–85%<br />
NAU’s acceptance rate is also high; reported figures often fall in the high-70s to low-80s percentile. A commonly cited figure is around 82%.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons for This Acceptance Rate</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Regional Focus &amp; Mission</strong>: NAU is regionally focused on serving northern Arizona’s educational needs but also attracts out-of-state students looking for a traditional campus environment in Flagstaff.  </li>
<li><strong>Enrollment Strategies</strong>: Like other state universities, NAU has capacity-based enrollment goals and offers admissions to a significant proportion of its applicants.  </li>
<li><strong>Broad Program Offerings</strong>: NAU’s range of undergraduate degrees, especially in fields like forestry, education, health sciences, and hospitality, supports a wide net for admissions.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p><strong>Important Considerations</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Year-to-Year Variability</strong>: Acceptance rates can fluctuate. If a university sees a surge in applications but enrollments remain stable, the acceptance rate might temporarily dip, or vice versa.  </li>
<li><strong>Program-Specific Differences</strong>: Highly competitive programs within these universities (e.g., certain honors colleges, nursing, engineering, business) might have more selective admission than the university-wide average.  </li>
<li><strong>Residency vs. Non-Residency</strong>: Public universities may have different admission thresholds for in-state vs. out-of-state students. In-state applicants might have a slightly higher acceptance rate because state universities prioritize educating resident students.  </li>
<li><strong>Data Source Variations</strong>: Different organizations (U.S. News, IPEDS, Common Data Set) may calculate acceptance rates slightly differently. Some include or exclude specific applicant categories, affecting the reported percentage.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p><strong>How to Validate the Acceptance Rates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check Official University Fact Books</strong>: Most universities publish an annual fact book or institutional data dashboard with up-to-date admissions statistics.  </li>
<li><strong>Consult IPEDS or Common Data Set</strong>: The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) and each school’s Common Data Set provide standardized admissions metrics.  </li>
<li><strong>Contact Admissions Offices</strong>: For the most recent or mid-year updates, you can reach out to admissions representatives directly or check the admissions section of the university’s website.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Each of Arizona’s three public universities generally has a high acceptance rate—ranging roughly from the mid-70s to around 90%. These rates are reflective of large state institutions with broad missions to serve diverse populations and maintain substantial undergraduate enrollment. To get the most accurate and current figures, always look at official university data or well-established third-party sources.</p>
